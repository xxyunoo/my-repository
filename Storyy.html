<p>On a rainy day, i was running around the neighbourhood at 2 am in my red silky mini dress . I was wet from the rain and i was crying, a total mess. U may wonder what would a girl be doing out at night messed up and alone, well that's not how i planned to spend my night anyway. So i was at my boyfriend's house and i was going to spend the night there. i was sitting on the bed while he was taking a shower, i got hungry and i headed to the kitchen to grab a snack. i opened the drawer to get some chips and i saw a big knife covered in blood and a piece of paper next to it. shaking, i grabbed that paper and opened it , inside it this was written "Emily Winsen, 20 years old, 2 stabs from the back right in the heart". i was so scared i didn't know what to do so i just grabbed my sandals and quickly ran out the door. i didn't have my phone so i couldn't call an uber . I was so scared and a lot crossed my mind, does the blood on the knife belong to the name in the paper? Or is that the next victim's name? Does this mean that my boyfriend is a serial killer? What am I supposed to do now? By now I guess he already noticed. I think I'm in danger. I shouldn't have ran away, now he knows that I know about it which means he'll probably try to make me keep it a secret.
At this point, I started losing the ability to feel time passing, all I was thinking about was what to do after I get home. I got tired and started walking instead of running. After i don't know how much time passed, i arrived at my house. I sat down, calmed myself a little, and after minutes , i reached for my landline phone and called my bestie, Rose, it was almost 3 am and I knew she would be asleep, but I was in desperate need of someone to talk to. I sat there biting my nails waiting for her to pick up, and surprisingly , she did. I didn't think, I just said "Rose, please come over , I'm scared , he's coming after me , I'm gonna die, I ..." she hung up and i just sat there shocked. After a minute she called back and said " Calm down , I'll be there in 10 min.</p>
